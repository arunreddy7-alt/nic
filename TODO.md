# TODO: Make Interior Project Pages Responsive for Mobile

## Information Gathered
- All interior project pages (beverly-drive, clarksville, contemporary-cabins, fairfax-avenue, family-farmhouse, vermont-modern) have similar layouts with navbar, floating contact bar, content sections with images and text, and footer.
- Main issues: Content uses fixed flex-row with large left margins (e.g., ml-55, ml-249) causing overflow on mobile screens.
- Images have fixed widths and margins that don't scale down.
- Text paragraphs have left margins pushing content off-screen on mobile.
- Floating contact bar is mostly responsive, but contact form margin needs slight adjustment (mr-12 to mr-4 on mobile).

## Plan
1. Update content layout in each page to stack vertically on mobile (flex-col) and horizontally on desktop (flex-row).
2. Adjust image positioning classes to be responsive: remove large ml- values on mobile, use w-full for full width on mobile, keep desktop sizes.
3. Adjust text margins: use text-left or centered on mobile, retain desktop ml- values.
4. Adjust contact form margin: change mr-12 to mr-4 on mobile for better fit.
